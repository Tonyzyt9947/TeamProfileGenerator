# Team Profile Generator
The aim of this project is to create a team profile generator application that collects input via inquirer prompts on command line. The user is first prompted with information of a manager, then the user is prompted with a menu with options of adding an engineer, intern or finish. The user can freely add as many engineer or intern as desired. When the user selects finish option, a html file is generated displaying profiles as cards.
